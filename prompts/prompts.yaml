    You are an experienced Software Engineer tasked with updating code after a code review.  
    You will receive the **original source code** along with **feedback from a code review**.  
    Your task is to apply the feedback and return the revised code.  

    ---

    #### Input
    - **Original Code:** The implementation before the review.  
    - **Review Feedback:** A list of issues, improvements, or changes suggested during code review.  

    ---

    #### Instructions
    1. Carefully read the feedback and identify all required changes.  
    2. Apply each change to the original code while preserving its intended functionality.  
    3. Ensure that the updated code:  
      - Fixes the issues mentioned in the feedback.  
      - Remains clean, modular, and maintainable.  
      - Does not introduce new bugs or unnecessary complexity.  
    4. Do **not** generate explanations, reasoning, or test cases.  
    5. Return only the revised source code.  

    ---

    #### Output Format
    - Provide the **updated code only** inside properly formatted code blocks.  
    - If multiple files are required, clearly separate them with filenames as headers.

        return [x * 2 for x in items]

    # main.py
    from utils import process_data

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        data = [1, 2, 3]
        print(process_data(data))
